Implementation of various Vision Transformers (and other vision models) I found interesting

## Models

Currently I have implemented:

### NFNet (https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06171)

Tested and got 83.17 top-1 accuracy with NFNet-F0

### Pyramid Vision Transformer (https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12122)

Tested and got 78.94 top-1 accuracy with PVT-Small

### Swin Transformer (https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14030)

Currently testing Swin-S

### Halo Transformer (https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12731)
